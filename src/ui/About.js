                  <p> We started Arthasoach in 2005. When we started our company, we knew we would be working together with our mobile carrier clients to help increase their top-line revenue.</p>
                  <p> We came up with the name Symbiotic because the definition of a symbiotic relationship is one in which organisms, people, or things exist together in a way that benefits them all. As our stated mission suggest, we exist to benefit our mobile carrier clients by increasing their top line revenue.</p>
                  <p> Since then, Symbiotic has seen unprecedented growth and is one of the largest and fastest growing VAS companies in India. We have generated multi-million dollars in revenue for our clients.</p>
                  <p> Our determination to help our clients succeed is only one facet of Symbiotic. When we started Symbiotic, we wanted to create a company that not only succeeded financially, we strive to take care of our employees, and to give back to our community. That is why Symbiotic donates a portion of every dollar we earn to make a difference in this world.</p>
